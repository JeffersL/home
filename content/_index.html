<h1>The International Department of Citizenship</h1>

<p>
The International Department of Citizenship is an
organizing body dedicated to empowering citizen
projects which lay the groundwork for revolution
and allow workers to control the means of
production in a democratic & decentralized world.
</p>

<p>
Our goal is to organize and coordinate actions
which challenge capitalism, injustice, and the
centers of power most susceptible to corruption.
</p>

<p>
We aim to create a central confederation which
facilitates a network of fully independent regional
mutual aid groups.
</p>

<p>
IDC1 is the online assembly of the IDC.
We create and manage digital tools and resources,
with a goal of establishing a communications
infrastructure to support and empower citizen
movements.
</p>

<p>
We operate as a collective, meaning we have a flat
structure without any bosses or orders. You’re free
to set your own schedule and create your own
projects to invite others to, but we have lots
objectives in need of help if you’re just looking to
get started with collaborating ASAP.
