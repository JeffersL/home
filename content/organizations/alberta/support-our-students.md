## Mission

We are Support Our Students Alberta, a non-partisan, non-profit public education advocacy group fighting for the rights of all children to an equitable and accessible public education system. We are all volunteers; we are proud, engaged citizens of Alberta who believe that when we meet the needs of the most vulnerable children, we elevate the quality of life for all children.  We volunteer our time and energy not for our own children; we do it because we believe in the institution of public education.
