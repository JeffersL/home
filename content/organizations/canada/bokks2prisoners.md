BOOKS 2 PRISONERS is an independent community-based group whose purpose is to broaden the range of reading materials available to prisoners throughout Canada. Our mandate is to provide free reading materials to prisoners as per request. All books are donated by publishing houses and by the general public and we cover the price of postage.
