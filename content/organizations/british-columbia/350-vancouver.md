## Mission

350Vancouver is independent group associated with the 350.org global mass movement tackling Climate Change. We are a grassroots-driven community run entirely by volunteers. We create climate-focused campaigns, projects and actions led from the bottom up by people in the Vancouver region. Our organization includes a diverse group of people of all ages and backgrounds who are passionate about the need for meaningful action in line with what climate science tells us needs to be done.
