## Mission

Our mission is to fight for the interests and well being of the musicians employed in our jurisdiction. We do that by collective bargaining and by putting all of our members on a sound business foundation. The many benefits provided by Local 145 to our members help to ensure professional musicians receive fair treatment and fair wages for their services.

## Member Activities

Many perks of membership, unclear what organizing activities exist
