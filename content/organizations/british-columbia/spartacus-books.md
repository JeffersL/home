## Mission

Spartacus is a nonprofit, volunteer-run store. We provide a free space for community events, internet use, learning, and fun! There are many ways that you can help us continue to do this.

## Member Activities

If you are interested in volunteering at Spartacus, please complete our volunteer application form [this is an online Google form]. As a volunteer you can take on a weekly shift at the store, organize events, promote Spartacus on- and off-line, or take on other tasks based on your interests.
