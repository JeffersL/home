## Mission

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)  is a global member-run union for all workers, dedicated to direct action  and workplace democracy. Formed in Chicago in 1905, for well over a  century the IWW has held that “it is the historic mission of the working  class to do away with capitalism.” As such, the union is organized and  run on direct democratic lines by rank-and-file workers.
