## Mission

Victoria Tenant Action Group is a membership-based organization committed to transforming the housing system and ensuring access to housing for all. Our members include tenants, co-op residents, and people experiencing housing instability and homelessness. We work in solidarity with all people who do not own their homes, and welcome the support of homeowners who share our vision for housing justice.
