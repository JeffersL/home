## Mission

Our Time is a national campaign led by young people and millennials who are championing a vision for a Green New Deal for Canada — an ambitious plan to tackle climate change and inequality together. Our goal is to organize and mobilize a generational alliance of young and millennial voters that’s big enough and bold enough to push politicians to support a Green New Deal in the lead up to the 2019 election. This campaign is supported by 350.org and a growing network of local Our Time hubs across the country.
